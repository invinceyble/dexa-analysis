# dexa-analysis

Small foray into using [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io) and looking at some DEXA scan health data.

## First impressions

Streamlit is pretty neat, I can see why data analysts love it. I think it's super easy to pick up for someone who codes to get things done and who thinks procedurally.
